## How to do it{#how-content-highlighter}

1. **Select content**: Decide on the content you want to test.
2. **Select a tool**: You can conduct this test in person, on paper, or online. If conducting the test online, choose an application that allows content highlighting and one that your users are familiar with.
3. **Define what you’re testing**: Determine what qualities you want to test for. You can ask users to highlight clear content and then confusing content. Or, you can ask users to highlight content that makes them feel confident and then content that makes them feel less confident. It depends on what your goals are. We’ll use clear/confusing for this example.
4. **Pick the colors**: Assign a color for each quality and explain what the colors mean. For example, “Use the green highlighter for information that is clear. Use the blue highlighter for information that is confusing.”
5. **Write instructions**: If conducting the test online, prepare instructions that explain how the test will work, what the colors mean, how to highlight text, and how long the test will take.
6. **Start the test**: Ask the user to read the text and highlight content according to your criteria.
7. **Discuss**: You can ask users to discuss their highlights during the test. This can be useful for longer pieces of content. Or, you can wait until after the highlighting to discuss. Encourage users to describe why they highlighted passages. For example, “What did you find confusing about that sentence?”
8. **Analyze results**: What did users think was clear? Confusing? How did the results differ across sessions? Identify priority content improvements based on the results.

## Example from 18F{#ex-content-highlighter}

- **Project**: [pra.digital.gov](https://pra.digital.gov/)
  - **Problem**: Site content was based on an internal document and not written for a public audience. The content needed to be approved by the general counsel before moving forward.
  - **Highlighter test**: The content was rewritten in plain language. Two attorneys reviewed it for clarity and accuracy using the highlighter method. Both attorneys reviewed the content at the same time, sitting at the same table, with their own copies of the content and colored highlighters. They discussed legal terms and wording with each other and the content strategist. In addition to improving the content, this test allowed us to avoid a later legal review.

## Government considerations{#gov-content-highlighter}

In general, content highlighter testing doesn’t require PRA approval.
