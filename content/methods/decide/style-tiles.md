## How to do it{#how-style-tiles}

1. Gather all the feedback and information that was provided during the initial kickoff of the project.
1. Distill the information into different directions a solution could take. Label these directions based on what kinds of interactions and brand identity they represent.
1. Create the appropriate number of style tiles based on the defined directions, which establish the specific visual language for the different directions.
1. Gather stakeholder feedback. Iterate on the style tiles, eventually getting down to a single style tile which will be the established visual language for the project going forward.
