## How to do it{#how-archetypes}
1. Gather findings from research activities such as  [contextual inquiry]({{ "/methods/discover/contextual-inquiry/" | url }}) or [stakeholder interviews]({{ "/methods/discover/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/" | url }}), user surveys, and analysis of customer data and organize them in a way that’s easy to review.
1. Analyze and [affinity map]({{ "/methods/decide/affinity-mapping/" | url }}) your research findings for patterns. Note frequently observed goals, motivations, behaviors, pain points, and potential harms (e.g. lack of consent, physical danger, being retraumatized). These patterns help form the foundation of each archetype.
1. Create sets of user archetypes based on how you believe people will use your solution and the journeys they are on. These archetypes typically get titles, for example, “the marketing specialist” and will include narratives that describe motivations in a relatable way.
