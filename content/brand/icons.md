18F uses a customized version of [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/) for its iconography. Feather Icons is [licensed under an MIT License](https://github.com/feathericons/feather/blob/master/LICENSE), with copyright belonging to Cole Bemis.

## Design Specs
Most of the icons retain the base styling of Feather icons. The 18F version includes a few adjustments.
* Icons are drawn on a 48x48 grid, with some custom detailed icons drawn on a 64x64 grid.
* Strokes of 2px, centered, with capped ends.
* For square icons, a min width or height of 28px.
* For circular icons, a min width or height of 34px.
* Minimum of 2px between elements.

## Get the icons
You can access a set of common icons in the [18F Google Slides template]({{ "/brand/templates/" | url }}) and view the entire icon library [in Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/4REk2fD6r4EmszRHuG1OaF/18F-Feather-Icons?node-id=244-18292) (only available to GSA staff), or [download the full set (zip file)]({{ "/assets/brand/dist/18F_feather.zip" | url }}).
