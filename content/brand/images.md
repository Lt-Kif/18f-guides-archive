## Representing humans
To represent a more diverse spectrum of human experiences, we’ve created an illustration library called *18F Folks*. 

*18F Folks* is based on Pablo Stanley’s open-source library [Open Peeps](https://www.openpeeps.com/). These are great for showing emotion and to represent anonymous user groups.

These are available to GSA staff in two formats:
* [Starter deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fAzoUwkfKAS2hy4YkqjHLqSQa_rvqiUyFpgACq6tRpY/edit#slide=id.g2efd29ee28c_0_0), which includes several character sets and a range of emotions as well as guidance on different ways to represent humans.
* [Full Figma library](https://www.figma.com/design/sA9t0Msi5Ycvx5ITVMJylU/18F_Open_Peeps_Mainfile?node-id=2328-21896&t=qWFSkRL1ga6yHdnO-0) for designers.
